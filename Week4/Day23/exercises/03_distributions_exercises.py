# Exercise 1: Compare different distributions
# TODO: Generate 4 different distributions:
# - Normal (mean=50, std=10)
# - Exponential (scale=20)
# - Uniform (0 to 100)
# - Bimodal (combine two normal distributions)
# Create KDE plots for all 4 on the same figure

# Exercise 2: Histogram with statistics
# TODO: Generate normal data (1000 points)
# Create a histogram
# Add vertical lines for mean, median, and mode
# Add a legend explaining each line

print("\n\nExercise 2: Histogram with Mean, Median, Mode")
print("-" * 40)
# Your code here




# Exercise 3: Box plots with outliers
# TODO: Create a dataset with some outliers
# Create a box plot showing the outliers
# Add annotations explaining the outliers

print("\n\nExercise 3: Box Plot with Outlier Analysis")
print("-" * 40)
# Your code here




# Exercise 4: QQ Plot for normality test
# TODO: Generate three datasets:
# - One that is normal
# - One that is skewed
# - One with heavy tails
# Create QQ plots for each and explain what you observe

print("\n\nExercise 4: QQ Plots for Normality")
print("-" * 40)
# Your code here




# Exercise 5: Complete distribution analysis
# TODO: Load or create a dataset
# Create a comprehensive visualization with:
# - Histogram with KDE
# - Box plot
# - Violin plot
# - Statistical summary printed
# All in one figure

print("\n\nExercise 5: Complete Distribution Dashboard")
print("-" * 40)
