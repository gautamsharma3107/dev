# Exercise 1: Create correlated variables
# TODO: Generate 5 variables with known correlations:
# - var_a: random normal
# - var_b: highly correlated with var_a (r > 0.8)
# - var_c: negatively correlated with var_a (r < -0.5)
# - var_d: weakly correlated with var_a (r between 0.2-0.4)
# - var_e: uncorrelated with var_a (r close to 0)
# Verify the correlations

# Exercise 2: Basic correlation heatmap
# TODO: Using the variables from Exercise 1
# Create a correlation matrix
# Visualize it as a heatmap with annotations
# Use an appropriate colormap

# Exercise 3: Triangle heatmap with mask
# TODO: Create a lower triangle heatmap
# Hide the diagonal and upper triangle
# Add proper formatting

# Exercise 4: Correlation with significance
# TODO: Calculate correlations and p-values
# Create a heatmap that shows both correlation values and significance stars
# Use: * for p<0.05, ** for p<0.01, *** for p<0.001

print("\n\nExercise 4: Correlation with Significance")

# Exercise 5: Real-world correlation analysis
# TODO: Create a dataset simulating student performance:
# - Hours_Studied
# - Previous_GPA
# - Sleep_Hours
# - Attendance_Rate
# - Final_Score
# Make sure there are realistic correlations
# Create a comprehensive correlation analysis with:
# - Heatmap
# - Bar chart showing correlations with Final_Score
# - Interpretation of results
