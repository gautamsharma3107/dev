MINI PROJECT 2: Weather Data Visualization
==========================================
Analyze and visualize weather patterns

Requirements:
1. Generate or load weather data (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
2. Create the following visualizations:
   - Temperature over time with confidence bands
   - Humidity distribution (histogram + KDE)
   - Temperature vs Humidity scatter with regression
   - Monthly precipitation bar chart
   - Correlation heatmap of all weather variables
3. Use Seaborn for enhanced visualizations
4. Create a professional multi-panel figure

This project tests your skills with:
- Seaborn visualizations
- Distribution plots
- Correlation analysis
- Professional styling

# ========== YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ==========

# Step 1: Generate weather data for a year
# TODO: Create daily data with realistic patterns


# Step 2: Create distribution plots
# TODO: Visualize temperature and humidity distributions


# Step 3: Create relationship plots
# TODO: Show how variables relate to each other


# Step 4: Create correlation heatmap
# TODO: Show all variable correlations


# Step 5: Combine into dashboard
# TODO: Create a comprehensive multi-panel figure


# ========== YOUR CODE ENDS HERE ==========
