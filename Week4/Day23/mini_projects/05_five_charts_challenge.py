MINI PROJECT 5: Create 5 Different Charts Challenge
====================================================
Your final challenge: Create 5 unique, professional charts

Requirements:
1. Create exactly 5 different types of visualizations
2. Each chart must use different data
3. Each chart must demonstrate a specific visualization technique:
   - Chart 1: Time series with multiple series and annotations
   - Chart 2: Distribution comparison (multiple methods)
   - Chart 3: Categorical data with grouping
   - Chart 4: Correlation/relationship visualization
   - Chart 5: Geographic or hierarchical data (treemap, sunburst concept)
4. All charts must be publication-quality
5. Save all charts individually and as a combined figure

This project tests ALL your Day 23 skills!

# ========== YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ==========

# ========== CHART 1: Time Series with Annotations ==========
print("Creating Chart 1: Time Series")
# TODO: Create a complex time series with:
# - Multiple lines
# - Annotations for key events
# - Confidence intervals or error bands


# ========== CHART 2: Distribution Comparison ==========
print("Creating Chart 2: Distribution Comparison")
# TODO: Compare distributions using:
# - Histogram
# - KDE
# - Box plot
# - Violin plot
# All for the same data in subplots


# ========== CHART 3: Categorical Visualization ==========
print("Creating Chart 3: Categorical Data")
# TODO: Create a visualization showing:
# - Grouped or stacked bars
# - Multiple categories and sub-categories
# - Value labels


# ========== CHART 4: Correlation Visualization ==========
print("Creating Chart 4: Correlation Analysis")
# TODO: Create a comprehensive correlation visual:
# - Heatmap with annotations
# - Highlight strong correlations
# - Add interpretation guide


# ========== CHART 5: Advanced Visualization ==========
print("Creating Chart 5: Advanced Chart")
# TODO: Create something creative:
# - Radar/spider chart
# - Treemap concept
# - Sunburst concept
# - Or any advanced visualization


# ========== COMBINED DASHBOARD ==========
print("Creating Combined Dashboard")
# TODO: Combine all 5 charts into one professional figure


# ========== YOUR CODE ENDS HERE ==========
