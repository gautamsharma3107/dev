## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand logistic regression for classification
- [ ] Build and interpret decision trees
- [ ] Use random forests for better predictions
- [ ] Calculate and interpret evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create and analyze confusion matrices
- [ ] Complete a classification project end-to-end

## ⏱️ Estimated Time: 4-5 hours

## 🚀 Study Order
1. Complete `01_logistic_regression.py`
2. Complete `02_decision_trees.py`
3. Complete `03_random_forests.py`
4. Complete `04_evaluation_metrics.py`
5. Complete `05_confusion_matrix.py`
6. Work through exercises
7. Build the mini-project
8. Take assessment (need 70% to pass)

## 💡 Prerequisites
- Day 24: ML Fundamentals & Scikit-learn
- Day 25: Regression Models
- Basic understanding of supervised learning
- Familiarity with train-test split

## 🔑 Key Concepts to Remember
- Classification predicts discrete labels (categories)
- Logistic regression outputs probabilities (0 to 1)
- Decision trees split data based on features
- Random forests = many decision trees combined
- Accuracy alone isn't enough - use F1 for imbalanced data
- Confusion matrix shows where your model goes wrong
