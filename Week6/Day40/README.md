## 🔑 Why MLOps Matters
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) bridges the gap between data science and operations. It enables:
- **Reproducibility** - Recreate experiments and models consistently
- **Collaboration** - Teams can work together effectively
- **Automation** - CI/CD pipelines for ML models
- **Monitoring** - Track model performance in production
- **Governance** - Audit trails and compliance
