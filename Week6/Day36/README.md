# Day 36: Advanced DSA for Interviews

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- Master tree traversal techniques (DFS and BFS)
- Learn common algorithmic patterns: sliding window and two pointers
- Understand dynamic programming basics and top patterns
- Practice 5 medium-level coding problems
- Build interview-ready problem-solving skills

## 📚 Topics Covered
1. Tree Traversals (DFS - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder; BFS - Level Order)
2. Common Patterns: Sliding Window
3. Common Patterns: Two Pointers
4. Dynamic Programming Basics
5. Practice Problems for Interview Preparation
