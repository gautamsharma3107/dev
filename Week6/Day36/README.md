# Day 36: Advanced DSA for Interviews

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- Master tree traversals (DFS and BFS)
- Understand and apply common patterns: sliding window, two pointers
- Learn dynamic programming basics and top patterns
- Practice 5 medium-level DSA problems
- Build confidence for coding interviews

## 📚 Topics Covered
1. Tree Traversals
   - Depth-First Search (DFS): Pre-order, In-order, Post-order
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level-order traversal
2. Sliding Window Pattern
   - Fixed-size window problems
   - Variable-size window problems
3. Two Pointers Technique
   - Opposite direction pointers
   - Same direction pointers (fast/slow)
4. Dynamic Programming Basics
   - Memoization and Tabulation
   - Common DP patterns (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Knapsack)

## 🎯 Interview Tips
- Tree traversals are fundamental - know both iterative and recursive approaches
- Sliding window can optimize O(n²) to O(n) for subarray/substring problems
- Two pointers work great for sorted arrays and linked lists
- DP is about identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
