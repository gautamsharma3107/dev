# Day 36 Study Plan - Advanced DSA for Interviews

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Master interview-essential DSA concepts: Tree traversals (DFS, BFS), Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and Dynamic Programming basics

## ⏰ Recommended Schedule (4-5 hours)

### Session 1: Tree Traversals (90 minutes)
- **9:00 - 9:45** → Study and run `01_tree_traversals.py`
- **9:45 - 10:30** → Complete exercises:
  - `exercises/01_tree_exercises.py`

### Break (15 minutes)

### Session 2: Pattern Techniques (90 minutes)
- **10:45 - 11:15** → Study and run `02_sliding_window.py`
- **11:15 - 11:45** → Study and run `03_two_pointers.py`
- **11:45 - 12:15** → Complete exercises:
  - `exercises/02_sliding_window_exercises.py`
  - `exercises/03_two_pointers_exercises.py`

### Lunch Break (30 minutes)

### Session 3: Dynamic Programming (90 minutes)
- **12:45 - 1:30** → Study and run `04_dynamic_programming.py`
- **1:30 - 2:15** → Complete exercises:
  - `exercises/04_dp_exercises.py`

### Break (15 minutes)

### Session 4: Medium-Level Problems (90 minutes)
- **2:30 - 4:00** → Solve problems in `mini_projects/`:
  - Practice 5 medium-level interview problems
  - Time yourself (20-30 minutes per problem)

### Session 5: Assessment (30 minutes)
- **4:00 - 4:30** → Take `day36_assessment.py` test
- Must score 70%+ (10/14 points) to proceed to Day 37

## 📝 Learning Tips

### While Studying Tutorial Files:
1. **Don't just read** - Trace through each algorithm step by step
2. **Draw diagrams** - Visualize tree traversals and array pointers
3. **Identify patterns** - Notice when to use which technique
4. **Time complexity** - Always analyze Big O
5. **Use the cheatsheet** - Keep `CHEATSHEET.md` open

### While Solving Problems:
1. **Understand the problem first** - Don't jump to code
2. **Think of edge cases** - Empty input, single element, duplicates
3. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
4. **Pattern recognition** - Ask "What pattern does this match?"
5. **Dry run your code** - Before running

### For Interview Preparation:
1. **Explain your thought process** out loud
2. **Start with clarifying questions**
3. **Discuss time and space complexity**
4. **Consider multiple approaches**
5. **Test with examples**

## 🎮 Mini Projects (5 Medium-Level Problems)
Solve these in order of difficulty:

1. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** - BFS application
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum** - Sliding window / DP
3. **Container With Most Water** - Two pointers

## 📊 Assessment Guidelines

### Before Taking Test:
- Complete all tutorial files
- Solve at least 80% of exercises
- Attempt all 5 mini project problems
- Review CHEATSHEET.md
- Feel confident about patterns

### During Test:
- Read questions carefully
- Start with questions you know
- Think about time complexity
- Write clean, readable code
- Aim for at least 10/14 points

### If You Score Below 70%:
- Review topics you got wrong
- Re-do related exercises
- Watch video explanations
- Practice more problems
- Retake test next day

## 🎯 Success Criteria

By end of Day 36, you should be able to:
- ✅ Implement DFS and BFS for trees
- ✅ Identify when to use sliding window
- ✅ Apply two pointer technique
- ✅ Recognize DP problems
- ✅ Solve medium-level problems within time

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Pattern recognition is key** - Most problems follow patterns
2. **Practice on whiteboard** - Simulate interview conditions
3. **Time yourself** - Build speed and confidence
4. **Review solutions** - Even if you solved it
5. **Explain to someone** - Teaching solidifies learning
6. **Focus on understanding** - Not memorizing solutions
7. **Keep a problem journal** - Track patterns you've learned
