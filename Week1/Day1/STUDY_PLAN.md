## 📝 Learning Tips

### While Studying Tutorial Files:
1. **Don't just read** - Type out the code yourself
2. **Run each file** - See the output
3. **Experiment** - Modify values and see what happens
4. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts
5. **Use the cheatsheet** - Keep `CHEATSHEET.md` open

### While Solving Exercises:
1. **Try without looking at notes** first
2. **Google is your friend** - Learn to search
3. **Test your code** - Run and verify
4. **Debug errors** - Read error messages carefully
5. **Only check solutions** after attempting yourself

### Mini Projects:
1. Start with the easiest one
2. Plan before coding
3. Break into small steps
4. Test frequently
5. Make it work first, then improve
