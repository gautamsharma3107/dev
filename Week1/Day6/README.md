## 💡 Key Concepts

### Linked Lists
- Nodes contain data and pointer to next
- No random access (must traverse)
- Dynamic size (no fixed capacity)
- Efficient insertions and deletions

### Two-Pointer Technique
- Reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- Useful for sorted arrays and linked lists
- Patterns: same direction, opposite direction

### Sliding Window
- Fixed window: constant size movements
- Variable window: expand/contract based on conditions
- Avoids redundant calculations

### Sorting
- Merge Sort: O(n log n), stable, extra space
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, in-place
- Choose based on requirements
