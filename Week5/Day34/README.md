2. Saving models with joblib
3. Model versioning best practices
4. Loading models efficiently

### Part 2: Flask API Development
1. Flask basics for ML serving
2. Creating prediction endpoints
3. Request/Response handling
4. JSON input validation

### Part 3: Production Considerations
1. Error handling patterns
2. Input validation
3. Model loading strategies
4. API response formatting
