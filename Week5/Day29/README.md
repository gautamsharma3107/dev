## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Neural Network Architecture
```
Input Layer → Hidden Layer(s) → Output Layer
     ↓              ↓               ↓
  Features      Processing       Predictions
```

### The Learning Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Input flows through network
2. **Calculate Loss**: Compare prediction to actual
3. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients
4. **Update Weights**: Adjust to minimize loss
5. **Repeat**: Until model converges
